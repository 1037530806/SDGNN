# SDGNN:Subgraph Decomposition-based Graph Neural Network for Learning Concept Prerequisite Relation in Educational Data

We have debugged the SDGNN model with linear GCN and GNN, so there are no deletions of GCN and GNN.

Finally, this represents the core implementation of SDGNN, while the remaining code will be gradually uploaded upon acceptance.
