# SDGNN:Subgraph Decomposition-based Graph Neural Network for Learning Concept Prerequisite Relation in Educational Data

We have debugged the SDGNN model with linear GCN and GNN, so there are no deletions of GCN and GNN

Finally, this is the core code of SDGNN, and the rest of the code will be uploaded after employment

# Coming Soon
